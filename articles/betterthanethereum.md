The concept of distributed games using blockchains is not new.  Many projects including poker have tried, but to my knowledge non have been sucessful.

Some poker sites exist, but they are centralized.  

The problems with ETH is its too slow.  Even 10second block times are too slow for a good user expereince.  The cost of executing contracts too is of an issue. 

With bitpoker, the approach is to use established, secure p2p networking protocols like whisper, and use bitcoin or etheruem just as the ingame currency or chips.

The approach solves the areformentioned.  We can think of them as side chains.  Just like Lightning network "bar tab" annlogy, the ingame transactions are really only important to those who are involved in the game.

We can continue to make in game transactions, and reach conensus within the game and to the agreed rules of the game.  In this case, Heads up No Limit Texas Holdem.
