Im sure that a denetralized poker app will be built, so why not build it?  PokerStars alone turns over $4.8 bn USD.  Over the past few months I have been working on some very basic software to validate the idea.  I believe that with Etherum and or the Bitcoin lightning network, plus small, private chains between players will enable the project to succeed.

I believe I have addressed a number of cryptographic problems, and have had a few algorithms reviewed by some Math Professors (I will cite upon their approval), but also looking for feedback and other ways to "game" the project.

Investors will be rewarded in a number of ways.
  A finite amount of tokens to be created and distributed to investors.  These may be the exclusive "chips" of the project.
  A very small rake per hand can be proportionally distributed to investors, or new token are created to increase the "chip" supply.  This should grow in proportion to the popularity of the project.  (Discussions needed)
  Oracles or witness nodes could be paid a small fee for witnessing hands, in more of a proof of stake scenario.

Potential issues, such as disconnects, could be solved by
Bonds as well as buy ins to be deposited upon commencement of play
The private chain of hand activity is only submitted to an Ethereum network which then arbitrates the hand and awards any disputes.

There is still a lot to be developed, but the application could be extended to a number of turn based games if successful.   Funds raised will be to pay developers and UX designers. 

I have started a draft paper and some POC software.  These can be found at https://github.com/bitcoinbrisbane/BitPoker/blob/master/README.md & https://github.com/bitcoinbrisbane/BitPoker
